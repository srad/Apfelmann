# Apfelmann

I created this project in early 2012 for fun because I was interested in a tutorial about [parallel computing with Qt at heise developer](http://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Parallelprogrammierung-mit-C-und-Qt-Teil-2-Bildsequenzen-parallel-berechnen-1433229.html).
and I was also interested in doing something with the HTML5 Canvas element.

Some features:

* A Mandelbrot Set is rendered with JavaScript and Canvas on the client.
* You can play with a bunch of sliders to change the color and interations of the algorithmn.
* Bookmarking a page can retain the settings so you can return back to the page and continue playing around or link your creation.
* The rendered image can also be exported as PNG file.
